    "    - the stdlib\n",

    "    - __but__ chances are you're not the first person to find it if it is\n",
    "- Read __all__ of the source\n",
    "    - documentation is good, but can be out of sync with the code\n",
    "    - read your source code\n",
    "    - read your dependencies' source code\n",
    "- Trust nothing\n",
    "    - verify your assumptions\n",
    "        - e.g. don't assume your file is actually closing when you call close()\n",
    "            - maybe someone monkey patched it... so don't skip it when stepping in pdb\n",

    "- Pair debugging\n",
    "    - Talk to someone (or a rubber duck) about the problem\n",
    "    - Helps spot misunderstandings or bad assumptions\n",
    "- Minimization\n",
    "    - Find the simplest example that can reproduce the problem\n",
    "        - eg, replace a call with a hard-coded result\n",
    "    - be careful with intermittent bugs though! You might not be proving the cause\n",
    "- Proximate cause\n",
    "    - Look for the recent changes\n",
    "        - but don't overlook the environment and how it interacts with the older code\n",
    "    - git bisect is a good tool here\n",
    "- Don't get distracted\n",
    "    - while taking a close look, you're likely to find other issues\n",
    "        - write these down, and continue your original task!\n",
    "- Don't debug in production\n",
    "    - Get the bug to happen in your dev environment\n",
    "        - If you can't get this to happen, that's a big hint"
